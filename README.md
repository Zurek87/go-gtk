# go-gtk3


Fork from:
https://github.com/mattn/go-gtk and upgraded to use gtk3


### Minimal Support of gtk3 and gdk3 on linux!

Priority is to run: `/example/demo/demo.go`

### ToDo
 - [x] Run demo.go in gtk3
 - [ ] Clean `deprecated` warnings
 - [ ] Rename `gtk` package to `gtk3`
 - [ ] Rename `gdk` package to `gdk3`
 - [ ] Split `gtk3` to separate files (11000 lines in one file is to much)
 - [ ] Split `gdk3` to separate files
 - [ ] Write more tests for widgets
